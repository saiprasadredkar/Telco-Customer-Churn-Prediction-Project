#Telco Customer Churn Prediction Project
Ever wondered why telecom customers leave their service providers? 🤔 Today, I’m diving into my Customer Churn Prediction project, where data science meets business strategy to help telecom companies retain their valuable customers!

About the Project
I built a predictive machine learning model that identifies patterns in customer churn, helping businesses take proactive retention measures before customers leave. This project uncovers the key factors driving churn and provides actionable insights for better customer engagement!

🔑 Key Steps in the Project:
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values in TotalCharges, converted categorical variables, and ensured high-quality input data.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Seaborn & Matplotlib to analyze trends like the impact of contract type, payment methods, and monthly charges on churn.
3️⃣ Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features that improve churn prediction accuracy.
4️⃣ Model Building: Trained Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting models to achieve high precision.
5️⃣ Model Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to fine-tune performance.

📊 Impactful Insights Gained:
✅ Customers on month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than those with long-term contracts.
✅ Higher monthly charges correlate with a higher churn rate.
✅ Customers using electronic check payments have a higher churn tendency.
✅ Lack of Tech Support & Online Security services increases churn risk.
✅ Fiber optic users churn more—possibly due to pricing or service issues.

💻 Tools Used:
Python 🐍 | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Seaborn | Matplotlib | GridSearchCV | Random Forest

This project helped me deepen my understanding of customer behavior analytics and apply data-driven strategies to business problems. Excited to explore more in the world of predictive analytics!
